# Yes-Bank-Stock-Closing-Price-Prediction
Objective:
The objective of the Yes Bank stock price prediction project is to forecast the future movement of Yes Bank's stock price based on historical data and relevant factors. The goal is to assist investors and analysts in making informed decisions by providing insights into potential price trends.
Data Collection: Historical stock price data, financial reports, news sentiment analysis, and other relevant information are collected from reliable sources.
Data Preprocessing: The collected data is cleaned, normalized, and transformed to ensure its suitability for analysis.
Feature Engineering: Relevant features, such as price momentum, volume, moving averages, and financial ratios, are derived from the preprocessed data.
Model Selection: Various machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or neural networks, are explored to identify the most suitable model for predicting the stock price.
Training and Evaluation: The selected model is trained on the historical data, and its performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics, such as mean squared error or accuracy.
Prediction: The trained model is then used to make predictions on unseen or future data, providing an estimate of the future stock price.
Market Volatility: Stock markets are inherently volatile, and predicting stock prices with high accuracy is challenging due to the influence of numerous factors, including economic conditions, investor sentiment, and geopolitical events.
Data Limitations: The accuracy of the predictions depends on the quality and availability of historical data, financial reports, and other relevant information. Incomplete or inaccurate data can affect the reliability of the predictions.
Model Limitations: Although machine learning models can provide valuable insights, they are not foolproof. The accuracy of the predictions may vary based on the model's assumptions, training data, and inherent limitations.
External Factors: The stock market is influenced by external events, such as regulatory changes, economic policies, or company-specific developments. These factors may not be fully captured by the model and can significantly impact stock prices.
